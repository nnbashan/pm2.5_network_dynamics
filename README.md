Abstract; In an era where air pollution poses a significant threat to both the environment and public health, we present an innovative network-based approach to unravel the dynamics of extreme pollution events. Leveraging data from 741 monitoring stations in the contiguous United States, we created dynamic networks using time-lagged correlations of hourly particulate matter PM2.5 data. The established spatial correlation networks reveal significant PM2.5 anomalies during the 2020 and 2021 wildfire seasons, demonstrating the approach's sensitivity in detecting regional pollution phenomena. The methodology also provides insights into smoke transport and network response, highlighting the persistence of air quality issues beyond visible smoke periods. Additionally, we explored meteorological variables' impacts on network connectivity. This study enhances understanding of spatiotemporal pollution patterns, positioning spatial correlation networks as valuable tools for environmental monitoring and public health surveillance.
